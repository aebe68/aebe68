- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aebe68
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in C++ webassembly and Iâ€™m currently learning how to use my large collection of C++ classes for web applications 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on reducing the environmental footprint of the WWW
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email aebe68@gmail.com

ðŸ‘‹ More about me

I have focused entirely on low level C++ for over 30 years, with a fair bit of html and JS thrown in. 
Somewhere in between all that coding I also managed to get a PhD in data analysis and AI (1998). 

ðŸ‘€ C++ for webassembly

There are two main functionalities that I want to make available to browsers, database and vector graphics. 
For example, suppose you are a home renovator and you are using a website to generate designs and drawings for the kitchen. 
The DB code is used by the browser to save the specifications for the kitchen locally for faster access and the VG code is used to render the kitchen plans. 

ðŸŒ± More on the environment
 
One way to reduce the energy use of the WWW is to replace JS with C++ (compiled into webassembly) and to shift work from servers to user devices. 
Again, consider the kitchen design web-app. With current technology the server renders the kitchen and returns an image to the browser. 
The goal is for the browser to render the image locally, freeing up the server and reducing data transmission. 

The combined goal is one of better user experience with a smaller environmental footprint.
